## Termirun-intergrated_code_runner_at_termux
- Generated with Doubao A.I.

- `termirun.sh`, A ready-to-use Shell Script tool aiming to run code files(`c,cpp,java,py,fortran,r` and extending...) using `Termux` on `Android(either root or unroot)` devices, convenitntly, by encasing the calls for multiple compilers into simple unified commands.  

- Recommending `termirun`'s association with `Termux`, `Acode`, `Acodex-Terminal`(optional).

- Beginner firendly(as you can tell I am a beginner myself)

- Secondary `README.md` file within the zip packages each,more detailed about settings, guidance, so on.
  
- The releases are in bilingual support, Chinese and English, identically functional.

- It is born only because the author simlpy wants to use his Android tablet to do coding works, and cannot find ways to simlpy set up a "run" button in Acode.

- Hell knows, it started in about 60 lines of codes okey, then 120, then 300, 500, 700, 1200, and I was like here goes nothing just say whethre its usable Fuieh~
