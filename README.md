# Termirun-intergrated_code_runner_at_termux
A Shell Script tool aiming to run codes(c,cpp,java,py,fortran,r and extending...) using termux on Android(both root and unroot) devices, in a simpler way, by incasing the calls for multiple compilers into simple unified commands.
It is born only because the author simlpy wants to use his Android tablet to do coding works, and cannot find ways to simlpy set up a "run" button in acode.
Hell knows, it started in about 60 lines of codes, then 120, then 300, 500, 700, 1200, and I was like here goes nothing just say whethre its usable okey?
Recommending termirun's association with Termux, Acode, Acodex-Terminal.
The releases now come in zip packages in bilingual support, Chinese and English, choose the one appropriate and unzip it.
There is specific secondary README files within zip packages, which is more detailed about settings, guidance, so on.
